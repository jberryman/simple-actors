-- A longer description of the package
Description:         simple-actors is an EDSL-style library for writing
                     more structured concurrent programs, based on the Actor 
                     Model. Computations are structured as "Behaviors" which take a
                     single input value, perform some 'Action's, and return the
                     Behavior to process the next input message it receives.
                     .
                     We also extend the strict actor model in various elegant ways.
                     See source for this type of discussion.
                     .
                     /CHANGES/: 0.3.0 - 0.4
                     .
                     - extend 'Control.Concurrent.Actors.spawn' to transparently support "joined
                       mailboxes", i.e. join-patterns, supporting synchronization between actors.
                       'Control.Concurrent.Actors.spawn' becomes polymorphic in new 'Control.Concurrent.Actors.Sources' class
                     .
                     - old @spawn_@ subsumed by polymorphic @spawn@, with @()@
                     .
                     - @send@ and other send-like functions restricted to Mailboxes, use 'out' to convert arbitrary chans to Mailboxes
                     .
                     - productMb, faninMb, and fanoutMb renamed 'Control.Concurrent.Actors.contraProduct', 'Control.Concurrent.Actors.contraFanin', and 'Control.Concurrent.Actors.contraFanout', and given more general types
                     .
                     - old @spawnReading@ removed
                     .
