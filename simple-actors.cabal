-- A longer description of the package
Description:         simple-actors is an EDSL-style library for writing
                     more structured concurrent programs, based on the Actor 
                     Model. Computations are structured as "Behaviors" which take a
                     single input value, perform some 'Action's, and return the
                     Behavior to process the next input message it receives.
